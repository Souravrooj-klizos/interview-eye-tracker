# Eye Tracking Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **MediaPipe Not Starting**
- **Problem**: MediaPipe was initializing but camera wasn't starting
- **Fix**: Added proper camera start logic and auto-start when tracking is requested
- **Result**: MediaPipe now properly starts the camera when tracking begins

### 2. **No Fallback System**
- **Problem**: If MediaPipe failed, there was no backup system
- **Fix**: Implemented multiple fallback systems:
  - OpenCV.js face detection
  - Simple motion detection
  - Skin tone detection for face presence

### 3. **Poor Detection Sensitivity**
- **Problem**: Eye tracking was too insensitive to detect looking away
- **Fix**: 
  - Reduced gaze threshold from 0.08 to 0.05
  - Added face detection for when user moves out of frame
  - Improved motion detection sensitivity

## New Features Added

### 1. **Multiple Tracking Methods**
- **MediaPipe** (primary): Advanced face mesh detection
- **OpenCV** (fallback): Computer vision face detection
- **Fallback** (final): Simple motion + skin tone detection

### 2. **Debug Mode**
- Shows which tracking method is active
- Displays tracking errors
- Manual fallback switching
- Real-time status information

### 3. **Force Fallback Mode**
- Manual button to force fallback tracking
- localStorage persistence
- Automatic fallback if MediaPipe fails after 5 seconds

## How to Test

### 1. **Main Application**
```
http://localhost:3000
```
- Click "Start Interview"
- Click "Show Debug Info" to see tracking status
- If MediaPipe fails, click "Force Fallback Mode"

### 2. **Test Page**
```
http://localhost:3000/test
```
- Isolated testing environment
- Step-by-step testing instructions
- Real-time warning display

### 3. **Fallback Mode**
```
http://localhost:3000?fallback=true
```
- Forces fallback tracking immediately
- Bypasses MediaPipe entirely

## Detection Capabilities

### MediaPipe (Primary)
- ✅ Face detection
- ✅ Eye landmark tracking
- ✅ Gaze direction calculation
- ✅ Looking away detection

### Fallback Mode
- ✅ Face presence detection (skin tone)
- ✅ Motion detection
- ✅ No motion detection (staring away)
- ✅ Head movement detection

## Troubleshooting

### If MediaPipe Doesn't Work:
1. Click "Show Debug Info"
2. Click "Force Fallback Mode"
3. Refresh the page
4. Test with fallback tracking

### If No Warnings Appear:
1. Move your head completely out of frame for 3+ seconds
2. Cover your face with your hands
3. Look at a different direction for 3+ seconds
4. Try in different lighting conditions

### Debug Information:
- **Tracking Method**: Shows which system is active
- **Is Tracking**: Shows if tracking is running
- **Camera Stream**: Shows if camera is working
- **Video Element**: Shows if video element is ready

## Expected Behavior

### Looking Away Detection:
- **MediaPipe**: Detects gaze direction changes
- **Fallback**: Detects face absence or excessive motion

### Warning Triggers:
- Moving head out of frame
- Looking away from camera
- Excessive head movement
- No face detected for extended periods

The system now has multiple layers of detection ensuring eye tracking warnings will work even if the primary MediaPipe system fails.
